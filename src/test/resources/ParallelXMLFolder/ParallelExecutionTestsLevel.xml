<!-- parallel = "tests" , thread-count="2" Suite tag only. parallel="methods" means 
	that TestNG will run test methods within a test class in parallel, and parallel="classes" 
	means it will run test classes in parallel. The thread-count attribute specifies 
	the maximum number of threads for each parallel execution mode.
	
	We can specify parallel attribute at Suite level - which applies parallelism to
	all tests defined within that suite.
	When you specify parallel="methods", parallel="tests", or parallel="classes" at the suite level, 
	TestNG will apply that parallel execution mode to all the <test> tags within the suite. This means 
	that all tests (or test methods/classes) within each <test> tag will be executed in parallel according 
	to the specified mode.
	
	We can specify the parallel attribute at the individual test level, which allows 
	us to control parallelism for each specific test.
	At test level, parallel attribute have 2 value 
	parallel="methods" , parallel = "classes"
	
	Now, If you give threadcount=3 then it means each test will have have one thread to execute
	now next even if you try to increase the thread count to 5 then also in the output you will see
	3 different thread id. reason parallism is at the test level
